# 💫 About Me:
I am a data-driven professional with hands-on experience in machine learning, time series forecasting, big data analytics, and applied cybersecurity. My work focuses on building practical, end-to-end solutions that transform raw data into actionable insights for business and security decision-making.

I have implemented stock price and volume forecasting models using regression techniques and advanced time-series methods such as ARIMA, enabling data-backed investment and resource management decisions. In the cybersecurity domain, I have performed intrusion detection analysis using PySpark, applying machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means, achieving ~90% accuracy to identify malicious network activity and strengthen security operations.

Additionally, I have developed credit card fraud detection systems, leveraging ensemble and statistical learning techniques to achieve 92% accuracy, helping organizations proactively identify fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses. I also enjoy building interactive, user-friendly data applications, such as Streamlit-based dashboards that combine EDA, machine learning model comparison, and visualization using Plotly, making complex analytics accessible to stakeholders.

My GitHub showcases projects across machine learning, big data, fraud detection, time-series analysis, and data visualization, with a strong emphasis on real-world impact, model performance, and clean, reproducible workflows. I am passionate about continuous learning and applying data science to solve meaningful business and security challenges.
